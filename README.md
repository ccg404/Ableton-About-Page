# Ableton-About-Page
This project is part of my front-end development practice. I'm sharpening my skills by recreating an existing website, focusing on replicating its layout, design, and user interface behaviors using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This hands-on approach helps me improve my understanding of responsive design, UI/UX patterns, and code structure.
